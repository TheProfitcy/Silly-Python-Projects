Silly-Python-Projects
=====================

This is a github of all the tiny (and quite silly) little projects I work on in Python both for my own learning and entertainment, as well as my Coursera Python classes. They are "An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python" and "Programming for Everybody (Python)"
